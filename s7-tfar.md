## Channel Guide
### SR Channels 
SR in Spartan groups work as follows, each : representing place value.
`Platoon`:`Squad`:`Team`

**For example:**
> *1-4, Team 3* would be on frequency `143`.

> *2-2, Team 1* would be on frequency `221`.

> *2-3, Team 2* would be on frequency `232`.

General channels for Spartan groups are their platoon # followed by two 0's

> *Spartan 1* would be on general frequency `100`

> 1st PLT: `51`

> 2nd PLT: `52`
